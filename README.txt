** A brief instruction **

- The source code is a single jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) named 

"final_laychiva_vannvatthana.ipynb".


- There is no need to uncomment any lines of codes before running all cells,

the users just have to make sure they installed all the libraries required.


- The two original data files .csv, "train.csv" and "evaluation.csv", and 

the notebook file "final_laychiva_vannvatthana.ipynb" are expected to be 

located in the same folder named "inf554".
